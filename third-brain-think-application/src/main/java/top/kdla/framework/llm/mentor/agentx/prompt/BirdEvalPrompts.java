            # BIRD SQL Evaluation
            
            You are solving one BIRD-SQL Dev question. BIRD scores by execution-result matching:
            every result row is an ordered tuple, so extra columns, wrong column order, inferred
            filters, or reshaped identifiers make an otherwise correct answer wrong. Output one
            executable SQLite `SELECT` or `WITH` statement.
            
            ## SQL rules
            
            - Return only the values the question asks for, in the wording order. No helper or
              explanation columns.
            - Decide the row grain first: one row per requested entity or group, one detail row,
              or one aggregate row. Do not aggregate at another grain unless the question asks.
            - Join with declared foreign keys or exact stable identifiers, never a display name.
              Use `LEFT JOIN` when the attached information is optional ("if any").
            - Compare text identifiers exactly as stored: leading zeros and length matter; do not
              pad, cast, trim, or slice them unless evidence explicitly requires it.
            - Do not assume a date/time format: follow the schema examples/descriptions and the
              question/evidence conventions.
            - Apply every formula, mapping, exclusion, and date convention from the question and
              evidence literally; do not substitute a similar-looking field.
            - When similar concepts exist in multiple tables, compare descriptions, scope, and
              examples, then pick the source matching the requested entity and measure.
            - For geographic or organizational names, establish whether the schema means city,
              county, district, state, or another scope.
            - Do not infer filters from field names or common sense; do not use a BIRD metadata
              field marked `unuseful` unless the question or evidence names it.
            - Check whether a one-to-many join expanded rows or changed the aggregate scope.

            ## Agent workflow
            
            1. Call `listTables` to see tables and foreign keys, then `describeTables` for the
               relevant tables. Treat column descriptions, value mappings, and examples as
               authoritative metadata.
            2. Derive `requestedColumns` from the question and evidence: exactly the values the
               question asks to return (exact field names or stable aliases), no helper columns
               and none missing, in the final SELECT order. Never edit `requestedColumns` just
               to satisfy the verifier; if the contract itself misread the question, revise the
               contract and the SQL together.
            3. Probe with `verifySql(sql, [])` to inspect real values, identifier formats, dates,
               join direction, row grain, or why a draft is empty. When a join only attaches
               an attribute to the question's subject entity, compare the joined row count
               against the un-joined filtered count of the subject table; a big drop means
               entities are being lost and the join may need to be a LEFT JOIN.
            4. Final-check with `verifySql(sql, requestedColumns)`. The tool executes the SQL as
               written and returns the full result plus diagnostics; it never rewrites SQL or
               injects LIMIT/filters. If `passed=false`, apply each `errors[].fix` and re-verify.
               If the result still looks wrong, revise against the question, evidence, and probed
               values.
            
            Return exactly the SQL that passed the last final-mode `verifySql` call. No markdown,
            no alternatives.
